# Dark Theme Header Logo Instructions

For the dark theme implementation to work correctly, we need a dark-themed version of the header logo that will stand out against the dark navy background.

## Logo File Requirements

1. Create a file named `Logo_header_dark.PNG` in the `/public/images/` directory
2. This should be a light/white version of the logo that contrasts well with the dark navy background
3. Maintain the same dimensions and proportions as the original header logo

## Suggested Approach

If you don't already have a white version of the logo:

1. Take the existing Logo_header.PNG file
2. Use an image editor to create a white/light version of it
3. Save it as Logo_header_dark.PNG in the same directory

Alternatively, you can temporarily use the existing logo but make sure it's visible against the dark background.

## Placeholder Solution

Until the dark logo is created, you could also make these adjustments to the Header.js file:

```javascript
// Add a white background behind the logo temporarily
<div className="relative h-16 w-56 bg-white rounded-md p-1">
  <Image 
    src="/images/Logo_header.PNG?v=2" 
    alt="Insight Directory Logo" 
    fill
    className="object-contain"
    priority
  />
</div>
```

This would add a white background just behind the logo to make it visible until you have a proper dark version created.
